<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>This is the <strong>first</strong> webpage I am creating. It feels good knowing how to put the word first in bold font.</p>
<p>In this paragraph, I want to take a word (non-noun), and make it italicized. However, I am going to do <em>this</em> with another command. There, I just did it.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things I have learned to do so far...</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make a title for the webpage</li>
	<li>Make a header for the webpage</li>
	<li>Make a paragraph for the webpage</li>
	<li>Put a word in <strong>bold</strong> font</li>
	<li>Put a word in <em>italic</em> using a different function.</li>
	<li>Create an ordered list of items</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a list of things that will help me succeed in Dev Bootcamp</p>
<ul>
	<li>Get adequate rest</li>
	<li>Make sure to take a little break within every hour I am studying</li>
	<li>Remain confident at all times. Every now and then, things can get confusing. I cannot let that get in my way of my end goal</li>
</ul>

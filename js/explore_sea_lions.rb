1. In JavaScript, "null" is the equivalent to "nil" in Ruby.
2. It is a good idea to use var, simply to avoid making the variable a global one, making it susceptable to being equal to something different in 
the program.
As far as I know right now, in Ruby, you can use signs like @ or $, to label the variables as instance and global, respectfully.  
Right now, I don't know if there are such options in JavaScript.
3. In JavaScript, you use "console.log()" and add the "+" in front of the variable.
4. In JavaScript, you use ";" to end a line of code.
5. In JavaScript, you use "//" to write comments. But, you can use "/*" to start a multi-line comment section, and end it with the reverse
of the characters. If I do it now, I will lose the comment capability here, and the aesthetics will not be as pleasing even if I make the necesssary 
fixes.

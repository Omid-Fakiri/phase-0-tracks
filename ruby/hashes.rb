=begin
This is the algorithm for the code:
- The user will be asked to input all of the information via the gets.chomp method.
- Symbols such as "Address:" (without the quotes) will be used in the program as input data.
- The output will be returned as a hash.
- The user will have an opportunity to update the client's details with an if/else statement.

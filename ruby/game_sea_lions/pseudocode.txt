-The game will ask the first user to input one word
-The game will have one method take the letters of the word, and replace them with "_" characters
-The game will have one method that will provide the user with x amount of guesses. x = "_" * 2
-The game will have one method that will replace the "_" with each correct letter guess.
-The game will have one method that will determine if the guessing user has won or not.
-The game will have a driver code that will keep the game going WHILE the user is within the guess limits 
AND hasn't fully guessed the word yet.


the user takes a guess. 
the program checks to see if the user has taken the guess before.
	If the user has taken the guess before
		tell the user that they have taken the guess before
		repeat to step 1(line 89)
	if the user has not taken the guess before
		record the guess as a guessed letter
		determine if the letter is a correct guess.
			if it is a correct guess
				update the space where the letter belongs
				repeat to step 1
			if the guess is incorrect
				inform the user he is wrong
				repeat to step 1

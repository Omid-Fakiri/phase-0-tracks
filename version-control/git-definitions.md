# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  `the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized. Version control is **important** for documents that undergo a lot of **revision** and redrafting and is particularly **important** for electronic documents because they can easily be changed by a number of different users. These changes may not be immediately apparent.`

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  `A **branch** in **Git** is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. Branches are used to make edits and additions in files before those changes go back to the master file. This can prevent information being edited on a master file before everyone (or a designated person) on a team approves the changes.`

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  `A commit records changes in the repository. A good commit message provides succinct details of the changes made without many words to explain it/them.`

* What is a merge conflict?
  `A merge conflict occurs when you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa. Or, an instance in which two people change the same lines in that same file, or if one person decides to delete it while the other person decides to modify it, Git simply cannot know what is correct. Git will then mark the file as having a conflict - which you'll have to solve before you can continue your work.`

  *Note:* I did google a majority of these definitions in order to provide quality explanations of these terms.  With that said, I feel that I do have a strong grasp of these terms.  Otherwise, I would not have made it to this point of the curriculum.

  *Note 2:* This note is the addition written in regards to the Release 2 portion of the assignment.  If Tyler sees this, along with the rest of the document in his PR, then this was done correctly...I think.
